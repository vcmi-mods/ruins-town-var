Born into nobility as the scion of a lordly lineage, he made a fateful choice to heed the beckoning call of Mother Nature. In forsaking his heritage, he faced the harsh rejection of his own kin. Seeking refuge within the leafy embrace of the Emerald Forest, he found a mentor who became not just a teacher but a cherished father figure.",
